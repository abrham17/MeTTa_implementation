This Metta cide are the solution for questions of chapter 2 of the book AI_algorithms,_data_structures,_and_idioms_in_Prolog,_Lisp.

The question:-
   1. Create a relational database in MeTTa. Represent the data tuples as facts
   and the constraints on the data tuples as rules. Suitable examples might be
   from stock in a department store or records in a personnel office.
   2. Write the “member check” program in MeTTa. What happens when an
   item is not in the list? Query to the “member” specification to break a list
   into its component elements.
   3. Design a MeTTa program unique(Bag, Set) that takes a bag (a list
   that may contain duplicate elements) and returns a set (no elements are
   repeated).
   4. Write a MeTTa program to count the elements in a list (a list within the
   list counts as one element). Write a program to count the atoms in a list
   (count the elements within any sublist). Hint: several meta-predicates such
   as atom() can be helpful.
   5. Implement a frame system with inheritance that supports the definition
   of three kinds of slots: properties of a class that may be inherited by
   subclasses, properties that are inherited by instances of the class but not by
   subclasses, and properties of the class and its subclasses that are not
   inherited by instances (class properties). Discuss the benefits, uses, and
   problems with this distinction
